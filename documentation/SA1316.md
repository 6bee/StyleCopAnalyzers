:memo: This rule is new for StyleCop Analyzers, and was not present in StyleCop Classic.
:memo: This rule is only active for C# 7.0 and higher

## Cause

Field names within a tuple declaration should have the correct casing.

## Rule description

Tuple declarations with field names should use the configured casing for the field names (see [Configuration.md](Configuration.md) for details).  See the documentation on [tuple types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tuples) for information on how to work with tuples in C# 7.

For example, the following code would produce a violation of this rule (with default settings):

```csharp
public class ExampleClass
{
  public (int ValueA, int ValueB) ExampleMethod()
  {
  }
}
```

The following code would not produce any violations:

```csharp
public class ExampleClass
{
  public (int valueA, int valueB) ExampleMethod()
  {
  }
}
```

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, correct the casing of the tuple field name.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
[SuppressMessage("StyleCop.CSharp.NamingRules", "SA1316:TupleFieldNamesMustUseCorrectCasing", Justification = "Reviewed.")]
```

```csharp
#pragma warning disable SA1316 // Tuple field names must use correct casing
#pragma warning restore SA1316 // Tuple field names must use correct casing
```
